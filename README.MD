# Conway's Game of Life

## Project Overview
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The game consists of a grid of cells that can live, die, or multiply based on a few mathematical rules. This project is built using the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. It features an interactive user interface and is designed as a tutorial to cover key features of React.

## Rules

1. **Birth**: A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
2. **Survival**: A live cell with two or three live neighbors remains alive.
3. **Death by Isolation**: A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.
4. **Death by Overcrowding**: A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.

The game is played on a two-dimensional grid where each cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
